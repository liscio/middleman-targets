# Welcome to middleman-targets

The `middleman-targets` gem is an extension to [Middleman][1] that gives you the
ability to specify multiple build targets and provides useful tools for dealing
with multiple targets and features.

- Generate multiple targets for different uses using the same basic project
  structure, content, and code.
- Assign “features” to targets which give you fine-grained control over what
  content appears in each target.
- Select images automatically based on the current build target.
- Use images selectively based on the current build target or feature.
- Include target-specific versions of data in a consistent fashion.

`middleman-targets` was written as part of the [Middlemac][2] Help Book building
system for Mac OS X applications, but it’s suitable for any project that
requires multiple build targets, such as software documentation, training
manuals, and more.

This documentation will refer to two sample targets: `:pro` and `:free`, which
is something that a typical software publisher might do.

Note that parts of this documentation will have different content depending on
whether you are building the `:pro` or `:free` target. These are just examples,
though, and all of the technical documentation is the same.
